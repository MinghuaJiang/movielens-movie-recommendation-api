# movielens-movie-recommendation-api
In this project, we will use the Movielens dataset and based on the instruction below to build a Spark Movie Recommendation Service using Flask.

We will further implement serveral different Movie Recommendation Algorithms and port the backend service on AWS.

Our final step is to build a web site like MoiveLens to recommend the films to the user using the backend service on the cloud.

Here is what we have to do:

    Understand how Spark works

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/

https://github.com/jadianes/spark-py-notebooks

    Try to set up Spark cluster manually on IBM vm cluster.

    Understand how to create Spark cluster on AWS.

    Start up Spark locally and finish building the service based on instruction below(Collaborative Filtering)

    Port the service to AWS.
    Build more algorithms using Spark.
    Build Web App.
